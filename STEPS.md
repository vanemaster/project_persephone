## How to build:

Download the content of this repository, then go inside <strong>project_persephone</strong> folder and run <pre>docker-compose up --build</pre> and after you hit Enter all should be set. Enjoy a cup of coffee while Docker does the work.

---

## Populate Database:

After everything is up and running, list your containers with <pre>docker container ls</pre> and get the ID from the container which has the <strong>web</strong> service in it. It should be called "src_web" or similar. After that, run the following comand to load the fixture file inside PostgreSQL:
<pre>docker exec -it #container ID# python manage.py loaddata women_shoes/fixtures/women_shoes.json</pre>
It should populate nearly 1041 rows.

The data for this fixture was extracted from Kaggle free datasets.
